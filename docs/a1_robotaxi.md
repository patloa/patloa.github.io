**Objective:** To understand the the factors influencing observed robotaxi demand in San Francisco
<br>
**Stakeholders(s):** The California Public Utilities Commission, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Authority
<br>
**Project period:** 2025
<br>

I combined data on robotaxi demand in San Francisco from September 2023 to August 2024 with publicly available 
information (including OpenStreetMap, the Smart Location Database, and the American Community Survey), estimated
statistical models, and developed presentations and journal articles outlining the results of the project.

The goals of this project were to examine the factors influencing *observed* robotaxi demand in San Francisco,
compare and contrast the factors influencing robotaxi and ride-hailing demand, and investigate how robotaxi
services are used in disadvantaged and equity priority communities.

The findings highlight the positive influence of walkability, job density, and land use mix on the number
of robotaxi trips that start and end in each census tract in a given month. Conversely, the results suggest 
that robotaxi demand is lower in census tracts that are designated as *disadvantaged communities* and *equity* 
*priority communities*. Furthermore, the findings point to similarities between the factors influencing 
rootaxi and ride-hailing demand.

The results of this project will support the development of policies that aim to increase access to the benefits
offered by robotaxi services and address the potential impacts of robotaxi services on the use of more 
sustainable modes.
