**Objective:** To understand the short- and potential long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic 
on the use of ride-hailing services in the Greater Toronto Area
<br>
**Project period:** 2020-2021
<br>

I was responsible for the development of a two-ave survey, the design of stated preference experiments,
the analysis of survey responses, and the development of technical reports, presentations, and journal articles. 

The goals of the project were to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the use of ride-hailing services, explore
how ride-hailing use could evolve during the pandemic recovery period, and investigate the potential long-term impacts
of the pandemic on ride-hailing use. 

Interestingly, although a large percentage of respondents indicated that they used ride-hailing services less
often during the pandemic than they did before the pandemic, a small percentage of respondents indicated that
they were using these services _more_ often. This subset of respondents identified a reluctance to use public
transit as one of the driving factors behind their decision to use ride-hailing more often. Additionally, there
was a subset of respondents who indicated that they would never use ride-hailing services again - even after
COVID-19 was no longer a public health threat. Furthermore, a subset of respondents indicated that they 
did not anticipate using shared ride-hailing services during the post-pandemic period, which could have 
implications for efforts to address the environmental impacts of ride-hailing services.

The results of this project provide insights into the potential long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on
ride-hailing use, which has important implications for transportation planning in the post-pandemic era.
