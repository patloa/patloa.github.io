#### Biography
I am an assistant professor at Toronto Metropolitan University and a member of the 
[Place and Infrastructure Theme](https://www.torontomu.ca/bridging-divides/about/) 
of the [Bridging Divides](https://www.torontomu.ca/bridging-divides/research/themes/place-and-infrastructure/) program.
<br> 

My research focuses on applying econometric, statistical, and machine learning models to understand travel
behaviour and travel demand. In particular, my research aims to understand how shared mobility services 
and advanced digital technologies can help people meet their mobility needs and access opportunities. As a researcher,
I strive to answer questions that can support the development of policies and strategies that contribute
to the improvement of mobility, accessibility, and sustainability. My research tends to be highly collaborative 
in nature and has included collaborations with the City of Toronto, TransLink, and the California Air
Resources Board.
