**Objective:** To understand the characteristics of ride-hailing users in Toronto and the 
impacts of ride-hailing on travel behaviour
<br>
**Project period:** 2019
<br>

I was responsible for the development of a two-ave survey, the design of stated preference experiments,
the analysis of survey responses, and the development of technical reports, presentations, and journal articles. 

The goals of the project were to examine the characteristics of ride-hailing users in Toronto, investigate the level
of familiarity that Toronto residents have with ride-hailing services, and explore the impacts of ride-hailing 
services on the use of existing modes.

The results suggest that ride-hailing users tend to be younger, own a transit pass, and live in denser parts of Toronto, 
and that ride-hailing tends to be used on a relatively infrequent basis. Additionally, the information provided by 
the respondents suggests that ride-hailing tends to be used for recreational and social trips (although there are 
respondents who used these services to get to work or school. Furthermore, most respondents indicated that they would
have used public transit or taken a taxi for their most recent ride-hailing trip if ride-hailing services were not available. 

The results of this project shed light on the segments of the population that are more likely to be ride-hailing users 
and the potential impacts of ride-hailing services on the use of existing modes.
